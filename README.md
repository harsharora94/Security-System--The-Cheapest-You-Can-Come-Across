# Security-System: The-Cheapest-You-Can-Come-Across
Developed a Security  System - The Cheapest You Can Come Across

## Overview:
The system will be a powerful and flexible tool that will offer this service at any time, and from anywhere with the constraints of the technologies being applied. This circuit is a simple switching circuit that uses cheap components such as the Photodiode, BC547 transistor, a 6Volt relay, buzzer, bulb etc. 

## Objective of the project:

The objective of this circuit is to create a line of light which when disturbed causes an alarm to sound..
